# How to make an awesome Arduino / PlatformIO package in 2021

This blog post is inspired by [How to make an awesome Python package in 2021](https://antonz.org/python-packaging/). 

We will go through all the steps from creating a small library to making them available via the the Arduino and PlatformIO library managers. We use Github Actions for unit tests.

## 1. Write some code
- Project
- Project/src
- Upload to github

## 2. Test it
- Install Platformio
- Create platformio.ini
- Create Project/test/test_library.cpp

## 3. Add examples

## 4. Publish to Github
- Readme
- License
- Tag

## 5. Github Actions
- Unit test
- Extra: Woohoo Github Badge
- Automatic release

## 6. Add to Arduino Library Manager
- Library specs
- Pull request
